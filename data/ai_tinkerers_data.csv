Currently, I am one of the founders of CopilotKit - popular open-source infrastructure for building in-app AI copilots (Chatbots, Agents, Textareas).

I’m a rising senior at UW Seattle and love building things and solving difficult problems. I’ve done a few internships and have worked on various projects all over the tech stack, but my skills are versatile enough that I’ll be productive doing whatever needs to be done. I recently worked on a POC for a early stage startup using generative AI to create technical interview questions, and even after just dipping my toes in the water, I was absolutely shocked at how many interesting ideas LLMs can bring to life. Feel free to reach out to me if you’re interested in working together!

I have been involved in AI for over 20 years, publishing my first paper in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 2005, and then doing graduate studies in AI at USC.

After leaving grad school I co-founded Algorithmia, a platform for hosting AI models, which was acquired by DataRobot in 2021.

More recently I have been interested in how to make better and more scalable user interfaces for machine learning data. My new company Hyperparam has been releasing open source tools for ML data visualization.

We pride ourselves on building in new spaces and with new technologies.   Since 2018 with the start of transformer based architecture, we've gone all in on Machine Learning, AI, and utilizing Large Language Models.
